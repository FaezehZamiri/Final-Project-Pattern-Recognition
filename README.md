# Final-Project-Pattern-Recognition
Final Project of Pattern Recognition
In part one(Regression)
Data:

o The purpose of this section is to estimate the depth using different satellite data and bands. On the left hand is the depth number and on the right hand is the 39 features.

Project Sections:

In the first section, suggest the best regression model with linear approach without feature selection.

In the second section, suggest the best regression model with linear approach by selecting the feature.

In the third section, suggest the best regression model with a kernel-based approach without feature selection (use different kernel)

In the fourth section, suggest the best regression model with a kernel-based approach with feature selection (use two feature selection methods, use different kernel).

In the fifth section, perform another regression method of our choice on the project data.

In part Two(CLassification)
Data :

o The purpose of this section is to classify the image with large volume and dimensions with different approaches.

o This image contains 162 bands and 307*307. Which has 6 classes. We divided the training data into two parts: test (30%) and training (70%)

Project Sections:

In the first part, we classified the image using the KNN method and the feature selection approach (we used two feature selection methods)

In the second part, we classified the image using the KNN method and the feature extraction approach (we used two feature extraction methods)

In the third part, we classified the image using the SVC method and the feature selection approach (we used two feature selection methods, we tested different kernels)

In the fourth section, we classified the image using the SVC method and with the feature extraction approach (we used two feature extraction methods, we tested different kernels).

In the fifth section, we implemented another classification method of our choice on the data in this section.
